Step 1:	Open the interactive map

Step 2: Go to Kokiri Forest, Room 0

Step 3: Open ZOOTDEC.z64 in a hex editor

Step 4: Go to address 0x02081000 (This is Room 0)

Step 5: Find a Kokiri Child in the interactive map, look at which number in the list it is

Step 6: Add (n * 16) to 0x02081000 with n being the number the kokiri is in the list (the first thing in the list is 0)

Step 7: Change the Y position to something negative or 0

Step 8: Load the game in an emulator, look at which kokiri moved

Steo 9: If it wasn't either Mido in front of the Deku Tree, or the kid in front of the exit, do it again

Step 10: If it was them, record the offset of the y position so we can edit it in the randomiser
